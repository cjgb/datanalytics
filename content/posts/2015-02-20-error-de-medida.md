Por su interés y oportunidad, reproduzco aquí y en su idioma original (la parque que nos es más relevante de) un breve editorial de [Simon Baptist](https://twitter.com/baptist_simon), economista jefe de [The Economist Intelligence Unit](http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx).

Así reza:

> This week we had some apparent good news with [Indian] GDP growth at the end of 2014 revised upward to 7.5% but, looking closer, **a large part of the good performance is due to changes in the way that GDP is calculated**. These changes are welcome, as they better reflect the structure of the current Indian economy, but remind me that the mind-numbingly boring issues of price deflators and sectoral weights are actually much more important to economic statistics than issues of reform or central bank behaviour. Although it is less exciting, **we economic commentators really should spend more time focusing on where our numbers come from rather than breathlessly extolling changes that are smaller than the likely measurement error**. Either way, really understanding the context of data and forecasts is critical to making good business decisions.

El subrayado es mío, que conste.
